# Solar Sail Dynamics with Fluctuating Radiation Pressure

## Overview
This project simulates the trajectory of a solar sail spacecraft by numerically solving a system of non-linear differential equations. The force from solar radiation pressure fluctuates based on solar activity, distance from the sun, and sail orientation, interacting with gravitational acceleration.

## Features
- Models the spacecraft's motion in a two-dimensional space
- Implements Eulerâ€™s method for numerical integration
- Compares constant and fluctuating radiation pressure models
- Visualizes spacecraft trajectories and phase portraits
- Modular Python code for easy configuration and expansion
